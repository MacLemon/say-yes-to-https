* SEO. [Google uses HTTPS as a ranking signal](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html).
* Speed. HTTP/2 can deliver your website to browsers quicker. HTTP/2 can only be used with HTTPS.
* Data encryption security. Passive attackers cannot eavesdrop on conversations.
* Server identification. Man-in-the-middle attackers cannot impersonate a website to a user.
* [New browser features are limited to secure sites](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features) and [capabilities will be deprecated for non-secure sites](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/).
