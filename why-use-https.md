HTTPS is the way forward for the web. Various organizations have decided that privacy by default is the future, and will actively work towards that goal.

* SEO. [Google uses HTTPS as a ranking signal](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html).
* Speed. HTTP/2 can deliver your website to browsers quicker. HTTP/2 can only be used with HTTPS.
* Data encryption security. Middle-men attackers cannot listen to conversations.
* Server identification. Middle-men attackers cannot pretend to be the server we want to communicate with.
* New browser features are limited to HTTPS sites. Browsers will soon deprecate features for HTTP sites ([1](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/), [2](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure)).
